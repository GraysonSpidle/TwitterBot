TwitterBot
By Grayson Spidle

I am in no way copyrighting this program or anything in it. I do not intend to profit off anything this program does or charge for the duplication of my code. However, if your Twitter account/program violates the rules of Twitter I won't be held responsible.

Read the Twitter rules of automation before making an application on Twitter.

*** CREDITS ***
ANYTHING IN THE "cleverbot" PACKAGE I DID NOT MAKE. I LEFT THE ORIGINAL COMMENTS IN THE PROGRAM TO MAKE THIS OBVIOUS.
I AM USING THE SOFTWARE UNDER THE GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN License.txt

*** LIBRARIES USED ***

twitter4j-core-4.0.4.jar
appengine-api-1.0-sdk-1.3.7.jar
clever-bot-api

NONE OF THE LIBRARIES LISTED ABOVE ARE OWNED BY ME AND CREDIT GOES TO THEIR RIGHTFUL OWNERS.

*** DESCRIPTION ***
This program connects to a twitter application, (I removed the access keys and consumer keys, you will need to provide your own) and makes the account connected to the application automatically reply it it's followers and following. Any user can unsubscribe to the bot by directly messaging the account: "unsubscribe"

*** USAGE ***
If you are going to use this program be sure to credit everyone that made the libraries you used. I would greatly appreciate it if you do give me credit but it isn't legally required.
